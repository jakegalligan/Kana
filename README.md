 Kana is a mobile first application that expedites the drink ordering process at bars for both customers and bartenders by allowing patrons to use their phone to order drinks and receive notifications the moment theyâ€™re ready. Bartenders are able to view and claim a drink from a stack of orders, as well as access a continuous stream of rich data, in order to better serve customers.
