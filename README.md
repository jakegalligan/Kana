## Description:
 Kana is a mobile first application that expedites the drink ordering process at bars for both customers and bartenders by allowing patrons to use their phone to order drinks and receive notifications the moment theyâ€™re ready. Bartenders are able to view and claim a drink from a stack of orders, as well as access a continuous stream of rich data, in order to better serve customers.

 ## Link:
 It is recommended to utilize this application by visiting the url: kanamobile.herokuapp.com 
 The username and password for the admin view is available upon request

 ## How to run locally:
 NOTE: If running locally get requests to server will fail as there is no connection to the database.
 To begin server navigate to server folder (/server) and run node index.js from the terminal(again, much of the data will not be available without connection to the database)
 To view the project locally navigate to the client folder (/server/client)
 and run npm start from the terminal.

## Notes:
This project was completed within a week as a final project at Project Shift Software Engineering Fellowship
The file tree was set up in such a way as a specific approach to deploying the application to heroku.
